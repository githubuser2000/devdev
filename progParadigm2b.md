Here is the English translation with very many emoticons, keeping the structure but making it readable and crisp 😄✨🧠📐📊⚙️
🧊📊 There are Crystalline Tables as a Programming Paradigm 💻✨
📍 Point
A single position, zero extension
📐🧱 Corner / Edge
A boundary, a transition, a sharp distinction
✅🪝 Hook
Connection, attachment, logical linking
📏♾️ Straight Line without Beginning and without End
Infinite continuity, pure direction
💡📦 Command and/or Box
Instruction, container, capsule, encapsulation
🔢💎 Number / Value
Quantified meaning, magnitude, hardness
🧭📐 Angle / Direction
Orientation, tendency, vector of intent
📚🧊 There are Libraries and Crystalline Tables — both are Programming Paradigms ⚙️🧠
🌌🏗️📐 Space, Construction, and Axes of Diagrams
With 3 or more dimensions 🧊🧊🧊➕
🔄🧩 Unification of Variables
Normalization, abstraction, equivalence
✔️⚖️🟢 Rectification, Correctness, Truth
Validation, consistency, reality alignment
🔁📊⚡ Behavioral Delta
Change, difference, transition over time
🧰📍 Coordinates, Hierarchies, Toolboxes, and Libraries — both Programming Paradigms 🧠⚙️
🗂️📐🏛️ Coordinate Levels, Hierarchies, Structs, Records, Addresses
Ordered space, layered meaning
🛣️🧭➕➖ Paths, Roads, Polarity
Unary ⚪, Unipolar ➕, Bipolar ➕➖
➕➗✖️📐 Addition and Derived Arithmetic Operations
Plus linear combinations, angles, and directions
🔄♻️🌀 Repetition, Recursion, Loops
Self-reference, iteration, cycles
📈🧮 Analysis: Functions y = f(x)
Plus dimensions as a topic of their own, polynomials 📐📐📐
🎯🎲📉 The Point of Probability
Compression 🗜️, compressibility,
difficulty class, level, hardness grade 💎
🧠🔗📑 Linguistics instead of Language
Tables are relational 🔗,
multiple relations inside a single table
🔺⚙️📊 The Simplex Algorithm (Optimization Problem)
and Perfectoid Numbers 🌌🔢
which unify all p-adic and n-adic numbers 🧩✨
🔹 Both correspond to each other
🔹 The optimization space ≙ perfectoid numbers
🔹 Vectors also correspond to p-adic numbers
🧾 Perfectoid numbers are written as
👉 multiple p-adic or n-adic numbers
👉 separated by several commas ➡️ a₁, a₂, a₃, … ✍️📐
If you want, I can also:
🔁 compress this into a formal axiomatic system
🧊 turn it into crystalline pseudocode
📊 map it to linear algebra / type systems
🧠 or translate it into category-theoretic language
Just say the word 🚀🧠✨
